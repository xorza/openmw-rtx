    /// settled on, the other derives them from the content files at an hour it was told — and that
    /// difference is real and stays. What was not real is that each then wrote them into
    /// `VisibilityConstants` itself, twenty-odd assignments apart, against no shared test: a field
    /// added to one and forgotten in the other is a `shot` that quietly stops predicting the game.
    ///
    /// Three of those have already happened. The sea's clock was filled by the harness and left at
    /// zero by the game, so every wave stood still in the game alone. The weather, the wind and both
    /// moons had to be added twice in one sitting. And `mAir.mUniform` — whether the air is an even
    /// haze or banked — was written only by the harness, so every interior in the *game* ran the
    /// outdoor coverage field a room is far too small for.
    ///
    /// **Everything here is already in the renderer's units**: colours linear, fog an extinction
    /// rather than two distances, the weather blend the right way round, the moons placed. What each
    /// side does to get here is its own business; what happens after is not.
