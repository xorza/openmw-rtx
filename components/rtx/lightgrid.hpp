    /// twenty-four times per pixel, sky included. Measured on Balmora's twenty-six lamps, the walk
    /// is 0.111 ms per lamp per frame at 1920x1080 — 2.9 ms on a frame that traced in 0.67 without
    /// it.

    /// A uniform grid, in **world space** rather than screen space, because a reflection or a bounce
    /// lands where no pixel is looking. Cell `i` owns `getIndices()[o[i] .. o[i + 1]]` with `o` the
    /// offsets: a prefix sum with a trailing sentinel, so the whole structure is two arrays however
    /// many cells it has and a lookup is two reads and no search.
    ///
    /// A lamp is binned into every cell its **reach** touches rather than the one cell it stands in,
