# Warnings are errors here and nowhere else: the tree around this belongs to upstream and
# `extern/` to third parties, and breaking the build on their warnings would only mean turning
# this off again. The extra checks were measured before being adopted — each of them costs
# nothing today. Three more were tried and rejected: `-Wfloat-equal` fires 29 times on deliberate
# sentinels, and `-Wold-style-cast` and `-Wuseless-cast` fire inside OpenMW's own headers.
#
# `-Wno-missing-field-initializers` is the one subtraction. Vulkan's create-info structs are
# filled with designated initializers, which value-initialise every field not named — that is the
# point of using them, and GCC does not distinguish it from an accidentally short aggregate.
#
# **Two lists, because some of this fork's files read the game's own headers.** Those headers are
# not clean under the extra checks — `-Wsuggest-override` and `-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant`
# fire inside them — so a file that includes one cannot take the checks. What it can take is the
# posture: `OPENMW_RTX_ERRORS` is the errors and the subtraction, for every file of this fork's
# wherever it is built; `OPENMW_RTX_CHECKS` is the extra checks, for every file free of those
# headers. Left on upstream's flags, a file that reads them warned about its designated
# initializers and nobody saw it, since nothing there is an error. The two functions below are
# how a target and a file take them, and a file that takes the errors alone is named where its
# target is, with the reason.
