// What a shared structure is spelled in, said once.
//
// **Sixteen headers said it for themselves, and each said a trimmed part of it.** A header that
// grew a `vec4` had to grow an alias and an OpenSceneGraph include beside it, and a header that
// lost its last `vec2` kept both — so the block drifted per file and a reader had to check every
// copy against every other. There is nothing in it that belongs to one structure rather than to
// all of them.
//
// **The namespace is reopened rather than nested.** Each header still writes
// `namespace Rtx::Shaders` around its own contents, which is where a reader looks for what a name
// belongs to. This only puts the aliases in that namespace first.

// **Asked for here rather than by each shader that needs it.** Five headers addressed a table by a
// 64-bit pointer and each declared the extension and defined the spelling for itself, then undefined
// it at the end — an order that worked because of which header happened to include which. Said once
// and left standing, a translation unit cannot get it wrong.
//
// **A shader that spells no 64-bit type gains nothing by it.** `composite.comp` and
// `wavecompose.comp` reach this header and neither declares `OpCapability Int64`: the extension
// permits the type and the compiler emits the capability only where one is used.
//
// **The scalar layout and the reference type travel with it, for the same reason.** Every shared
// structure is read in scalar layout and every 64-bit address in one becomes a reference, so a
// shader that includes any of these headers wants all three.
