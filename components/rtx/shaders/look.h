// Every number that decides how the picture looks, in one file, so that tuning it is reading one
// file rather than remembering which of thirty holds the dial.
//
// **What belongs here is a number somebody turns to change the frame.** Its source does not decide
// that: a taste dial nobody measured, a real constant that fixes a colour, and a sample count that
// fixes how clean the frame is are all things a person reaches for when the picture is wrong. What
// does not belong is everything the picture does not depend on — units and maths, buffer and grid
// sizes, workgroups, traversal masks, enumerations, and the biases and guards that keep the
// arithmetic honest. Those stayed where they are, beside the code that has to agree with them.
//
// **One dial stayed behind, and says why where it stands.** `WATER_CAUSTIC_MAX` in `scene.h` clips
// the brightest filament, and the polynomial beneath it is fitted against that clip: the two are one
// statement, and separating them would leave a dial whose fit lives somewhere else.
//
// The order is the order the light travels in reverse, from the eye outward: what the frame is
// exposed and graded through, then the sky that lights it, the surfaces it lands on, the bounce off
// them, the air in front of all of it, the water, the sprites, and last how many frames and samples
// go into settling the result.
