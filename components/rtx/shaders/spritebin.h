// What bins the sprite layer into the screen's tiles on the device, as both sides see it.
//
// **On the device and not the host, and a rainstorm is why.** Binned on the processor, every
// sprite is projected twice, its tiles counted and then filled, and the whole list written across
// the bus — a stretch of the frame's critical path, and a cost that grows with the tile count
// whatever the sprites do. Here the sprites and the emitters are already on the device for the
// trace to read, so three
// dispatches make the list where it is read: one per sprite for its tiles and their counts, one
// over the tiles for where each run starts, and one per tile that fills its run in order.
//
// **The list comes out in the shape `Rtx::RunList` makes**, because the trace reads that shape
// and the light grid still arrives in it from the host: the first `tiles + 1` entries say where
// each tile's run starts, counted from the front, and the runs follow them. What the host promised
// of it is kept — ascending sprite index within a run, which is the composite order — and it is
// kept by construction rather than by a sort: a tile fills its own run by walking the sprites in
// order, so no atomic ever decides where an entry lands.
