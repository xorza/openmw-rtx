// A digest of the frame's images, taken on the device: what a comparison of two runs compares
// where the picture past the upscaler is the network's and not this renderer's. `digest.comp`
// folds every texel of every image into four words an image, a workgroup at a time, and the host
// folds the words of the texels the same way in a test, so the two are one function of an image's
// bits and neither trusts the other.
//
// **Four words, each a sum or an exclusive-or over the texels.** Both are commutative, so the
// order the workgroups land in — which is the device's and never the same twice — cannot reach the
// answer. Two independent mixes of each texel, kept apart as a sum and as an exclusive-or, are a
// hundred and twenty-eight bits a single changed bit anywhere in the image moves.
