// What the fog volume's images are made of and where each one is bound, said once for both sides
// that have to agree. `gbuffer.h` says what a channel costs when its format and its image's drift.
//
// **Four formats and not one**, because two of these images hold a single channel: the sun's
// transport is a product of transmittances and carries no colour, so the accumulated and the
// per-slice copies of it are half floats one wide. The column depth is a world distance and is the
// one thing here a half float cannot hold.
//
// **The column's moon terms are the fourth, and they stay full width for what a half would move
// rather than for what it could not hold.** `fogPhase` peaks at 345 at exact forward scatter and
// the brightest pixel this game reaches is under nine, so a half has room to spare — and rounding
// the term every froxel of a night reads would move the night's air for a megabyte at 1080p.

// Which binding of `SET_VOLUME` each image is, for the shaders that declare them and the owner that
// writes them.
//
// **Eleven images and nineteen bindings, eight of them named twice**, because Vulkan has no
// descriptor a shader may both sample and store through — and every one but a pair's history is
// written by one pass and read by the next. The column depth is named once: both passes reach it
// through the one storage binding.
//
// **Sampled first and storage after**, so `FOG_SAMPLED_COUNT` is a bound rather than a table, and
// the layout and the writes cannot disagree about which kind a binding is.
