// What the wavelet's temporal half needs. Included verbatim by both sides, for the reason
// `visibility.h` is.

// What each of the three histories is made of, said once for both sides that have to agree.
//
// **The pass's own, and not the G-buffer's.** A channel the trace writes and a history the denoiser
// keeps share nothing but a number of bits, and a history built from a radiance channel's width or
// `GBUFFER_SURFACE` is narrowed silently whenever a channel is narrowed for the trace's sake — with
// the evidence for the history's width lying somewhere else entirely. The paragraph below is that
// evidence.
//
// **Half floats for the mean and the surface, because neither builds a reference.** What holds the
// radiance channels at full width is an argument about rounding a term before adding it to a
// thousand others. A normal is compared against a neighbour's, and a mean is a running value
// replaced every frame rather than a thousand terms added into one, and no pixel of the bounce
// comes near the 65504 a half holds.
//
// **What the mean pays for it is a floor on how slowly it may move.** The average is exponential
// with `alpha = 1 / ACCUMULATE_FRAMES`, so a frame moves the stored value by a sixteenth of the
// difference — and where that sixteenth falls under half a quantisation step it rounds back to where
// it was. A half's step is between 2^-12 and 2^-11 of the value, so the average stalls on
// differences under 0.4 to 0.8 per cent of it, which the cascade's error against a converged
// reference does not show; `filter.cpp` carries the pair.
//
// **And the moments stay full floats whatever the other two do.** `E[l²] - E[l]²` is a difference of
// two numbers that are nearly equal once a pixel has settled, and a format that rounds each of them
// separately loses the whole of what is left.
