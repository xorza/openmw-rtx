// The sun glare fader: the wash of colour the game lays over the whole picture while the eye is
// turned toward a sun it can see.
//
// **The rasterizer's `SunGlareCallback`, in its own numbers.** The game states it as four:
// `Weather_Sun_Glare_Fader_Color`, doubled and clamped as the original did by setting one colour
// on two material terms; `_Max`, the most of the picture it may wash; `_Angle_Max`, the angle off
// the eye's axis at which it has faded to nothing; and the time-of-day fade the weather manager
// steps through dawn and dusk. Times the weather's `Glare_View`, and times how much of the sun's
// own quad the eye can see — an occlusion query over the quad's opaque texels against the world's
// depth, eased at ten per second toward what the query found. The trace has no query and no
// depth; it has the primary rays, and the ones inside the quad's disc say the same thing.
