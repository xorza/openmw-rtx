// GLSL needs none of it: `vec3` is a builtin and a program-scope `const` is already where it wants

// global scope would be a poor trade for a shared header.

// would otherwise define the same function twice and fail to link; GLSL compiles a single
// translation unit and has nothing to say about it.

// **What the host takes is the scalar arithmetic and not the shading maths.** A shading language's
// vectors are OpenSceneGraph's on this side and it has no use for a second set — but a curve a
// shader is fitted to is a curve a test has to be able to call, and a fit nobody can check is a
