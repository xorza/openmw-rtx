// The debug lines and triangles drawn over the picture: the navmesh, the pathgrid, the actors'
// paths, the recast mesh and the collision shapes, which the game builds as `osg::Geometry` under
// `Mask_Debug` and a ray cannot meet.
//
// **Rasterized, and depth-tested against the trace.** A line has no area for a ray to land on, so
// the one graphics pipeline beside the interface's draws them, projected through the frame's own
// camera by the inverse of `rayAt`, and each fragment is kept where it stands nearer than the
// surface the eye's ray met at that pixel — the traced depth, read at the nearest texel. A tool
// and not the picture: drawn after the curve and before the interface, in the display's own values
// the drawers painted them in.
