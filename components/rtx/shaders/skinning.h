// What poses a skinned body or a morphed face on the device, as both sides see it. Included
// verbatim by the host and by the two kernels, for the reason `scene.h` is: a row the host packs and
// a kernel reads has to be one row.
//
// **The arithmetic is `SceneUtil::RigGeometry::cull`'s and `MorphGeometry::cull`'s, and nothing
// else.** A skin is `p · Σ w_i B_i` with `B_i` the bone's inverse bind, its skeleton-space matrix and
// the skin transform composed on the host; a normal and a tangent take the linear part of the same
// sum and are not normalised, because the rasterizer does not. A morph is the base plus every
// target's offset at its weight, positions only. What the game draws is the target, and these are
// its numbers.
