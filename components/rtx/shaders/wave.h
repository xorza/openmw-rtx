// The sea as a set of transformed tiles rather than as a list of sinusoids.
//
// **A sum of plane waves is quasi-periodic, and curvature is where that shows.** The second
// derivative weights a component by `A k²`, so the shortest few own it however the spectrum falls —
// and a handful of plane waves crossing is a lattice, which is what a seabed draws under one. No
// allocation of sixty-four components fixes that: the fix is thousands of components, which is a
// transform.
//
// **And it is the cheaper of the two.** A tile costs three texture fetches where the sum was
// sixty-four sines, and the surface is read twice per water pixel — once for the normal and once for
// the curvature. The synthesis is one pass a frame over a few small grids.
