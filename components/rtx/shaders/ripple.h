// What walked through the water: a height field around the eye, stepped by the wave equation and
// stamped where an actor wades, a projectile lands or a spell strikes, and read by the sea as one
// more tile beside its cascades.
//
// **The rasterizer's own simulation, in its own numbers.** `MWRender::RipplesSurface` runs a
// thousand-and-twenty-four-texel field at two and a half units a texel, centred on the player and
// stepped sixty times a second, with `lib/water/ripples.glsl`'s springs. The trace takes the same
// field and reads it as a wave tile: a slope and a curvature with a chain each, so a wake is lit,
// reflected and refracted the way a swell is, and focuses light on the bed under it the way a
// swell does.
