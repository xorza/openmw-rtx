// What one wavelet level of the denoiser needs. Included verbatim by both sides, for the reason
// `visibility.h` is.

// What a level reads and writes, said once for both sides that have to agree.
//
// **The cascade's own, and not the trace's.** The levels ping-pong between the image the
// accumulator blended into and a scratch of this pass's own, so `CHANNEL_INDIRECT` is written once
// by the trace and read once by whatever consumes it. That is what lets the two formats part: a
// reference is built through that channel and never through this one.
//
// **Half floats, because a filtered bounce is shown and never summed.** A reference is built with
// the denoiser switched off, so nothing here reaches one — where the argument that holds the
// radiance at full width, `RadianceWidth::Summed`, is entirely about a term added to a thousand
// others.
//
// **What it costs is a floor, and the floor is measured.** Each level rounds what it stores, which
// over five levels put about 3e-4 of the value under the cascade's own error — visible only where the cascade
// had already driven that error below it, which is a flat sheet under a smooth sky.
// `theFilterAndItsHistoryConvergeOnAGrazingSurface` is that scene, and it carries the pair of
// figures.
