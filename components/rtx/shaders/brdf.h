// The surface every lit solid is: glTF 2.0's metal and roughness, a GGX lobe with Smith's
// height-correlated masking and Schlick's Fresnel over a Lambert base. A vanilla surface is this
// surface with a reflectance of nought, which `SPECULAR_EDGE_SCALE` makes reflect exactly nothing.
//
// **Shared, because two sides evaluate the lobe and they have to evaluate one lobe.** The shader
// takes it at every light a surface is lit by and draws its bounce from it; `Rtx::SpecularAlbedo`
// integrates it over the hemisphere on the host, once, by the same draw, into the table the shader
// reads the lobe's energy back out of. A table integrated from a second copy of these would
// compensate a lobe the shader does not draw.
