// Where set 0's inputs are bound, for the shader that declares them and the pass that writes them.
//
// **Two lists of the same numbers, kept in step by hand, is how a shader comes to read a table
// nobody wrote.** The pass builds its layout and its writes by index and the shader declares each
// binding by number; nothing but a count checked at the end connected the two, so a binding added
// in one place and forgotten in the other is a descriptor left unwritten and a dispatch reading
// whatever the slot holds.
//
// **The scene's tables are not here.** They travel as addresses in the frame block — `GpuTables` in
// `scene.h` — so what is left to bind is what has no table to ride in: the structure, the hit
// counter, the block itself, and the images the trace samples.
//
// Set 0 alone. The other three are a bindless texture array, the channels the trace writes and the
// air in front of the camera, and each of those is one owner's to number.
//
// **Here rather than beside the shader that declares them**, because this is where a header both
// languages read has to sit: `portable.h` is next to it, and the shader compiler is given this
// directory and no other.
