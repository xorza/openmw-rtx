    /// **Morrowind's textures were lit before they were saved.** Ambient occlusion in the corners,
    /// a highlight along a rim, the glow a lamp casts on the wall behind it — all of it is in the
    /// texels, because the engine they were drawn for could not put it there any other way. A ray
    /// tracer then lights them a second time, and the result is a room whose corners are dark twice
    /// over and whose lamps have a halo the light itself did not make.
    ///
    /// What this holds is the low-frequency part of a texture's brightness, as a factor to divide
    /// out. Two properties make that safe to do:
    ///
    /// - **It is normalised to average one**, so it moves light around a texture and never changes
    ///   how much of it there is.
    /// - **It is clamped**, so a texture whose darkest corner is genuinely black — paint rather than
    ///   shadow — is dimmed and brightened by at most a factor of two either way.
    ///
    /// **Coarse on purpose.** Painted lighting varies slowly across a surface and painted detail
    /// does not, so a grid this size follows the first and cannot follow the second: a checkerboard
    /// alternating every texel averages flat in every cell and comes back neutral. Following detail
    /// is the over-correction that flattens a texture into a colour.
