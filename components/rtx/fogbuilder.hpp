    /// office, which is further off than any wall in it — so the original draws that room with no
    /// fog whatsoever, where a medium matched at its half-life puts a tenth of one between the eye
    /// and the far wall. A medium has no clear zone to answer that with.
    ///

    /// colour; this air is *lit*, by every lamp that reaches it — `fogLight` — so a room with two
    /// dozen candles in it scatters far more than the recorded colour ever stood for. The two are
    /// not the same quantity, which is why matching one over-delivers the other. Measured in that
    /// customs office, the air lifts the frame's black level from 1 of 255 to 48.

    /// black level comes to 27, which is a room with candlelight still hanging in the air under the
    /// chandelier and no longer a grey floor under everything else. Twelve takes it to 18 and the
    /// air stops reading as anything at all; three leaves it at 36 and the wash is still there.
