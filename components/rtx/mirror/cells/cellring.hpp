    /// geometry by the eye's distance on the frame that first meets it — two thirds of the tail a
    /// cell ring costs, measured. A ray tracer has no draw calls to save: a top level takes a
    /// thousand instances of one bottom level as one entry apiece, and a cell's own 65 × 65 grid
    /// meets its neighbours vertex for vertex.
    ///
    /// Two rings, and a thread between them. The *prepared* ring is the reach plus one band: each
    /// cell in it has been read by the thread and adopted by the frame into the scene, so its
    /// meshes stand on the device before anything can see them. The *placed* ring is the reach: a
    /// cell in it has its ground in the top level, and outside the active grid its statics too. A
    /// frame adopts at most one prepared cell and moves the placements of the cells that crossed a
    /// boundary. This is the policy; `CellHolds` is the bookkeeping of what the reader lent and
    /// the holds adoption took; `CellPlacer` is what stands and by what rule. A model's drawable
    /// is the template's, so a mesh adopted here is the mesh the frame's walk finds under the
    /// clone when the cell becomes active, and nothing is uploaded twice. The ground's rows are
    /// the ring's own: no drawable will ever name them, so the placer holds them on the scene. What
    /// this adopts goes through the extractor's own resolvers inside the walk (`SceneAdopter`),
    /// and holds by `Known::mHolds` rather than being named again on every walk. Everything the
    /// thread reads is lent and given back — `Spares` says why an address and not a shared count,
    /// and `giveBackHolds` why a hold is a cell's.
    ///
    /// **The lamps of the cells the game has not loaded are the ring's too.** `REC_LIGH` is not a
    /// paged type and must not become one, because both renderers read the paging's type filter;
    /// what this fork cannot keep is the light, because rays go everywhere, and a town four cells
    /// away that goes dark at dusk is the world stating something the content files do not. Read
