// The shells of a cloud the content modelled as geometry, gathered along the eye's ray as one
// medium rather than met one surface at a time.
//
// **What this is for.** `meshes/f/active_blight_large.nif` is eleven alpha shells over one another,
// and neither of its textures holds a single opaque texel. A ray tracer that peels the nearest of
// those and paints the next one as though it were opaque draws a cloud as a flat red sheet.
//
// **One traversal for the whole stack.** The eye's own ray walks past every medium it meets —
// `candidateStops` is where that is decided — so it commits the mountain behind the cloud and this
// walk gathers what stands in front of it, on a mask no other instance carries. Re-tracing per layer
// is the alternative, and Anagnostou measures it at an order of magnitude over the same picture
// alpha-blended by a rasterizer. This walk costs a fraction of the trace under a cloud and nothing
// in a cell with none.
//
// Kostas Anagnostou, *Raytraced Order Independent Transparency*:
// https://interplayoflight.wordpress.com/2023/07/15/raytraced-order-independent-transparency/
//
// **Thickness rather than coverage** is Umenhoffer and Szirmay-Kalos's, whose spherical billboards
// measure how much medium a ray crosses rather than how much of a pixel a card fills:
// https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7a249dbd873f02248eecc3ebf811b71ea5e90277
//
// **Order-independent, because there is no order to be had.** A candidate loop meets the shells in
// whatever order the structure hands them over, so they are composited by what they mean rather than
// by depth: the exact total coverage `1 - prod(1 - a)`, filled with the coverage-weighted mean
// colour and taken at the coverage-weighted depth. That is exact for one shell and for any number of
// shells of one colour, which is what a cloud is.
