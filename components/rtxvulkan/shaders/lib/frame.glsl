//
// **Each of these was a test written out in five or six places, and no two of the spellings had
// to agree.** Whether there is a sun was `HAS_SUN && mSunIrradiance != vec3(0.0)` in the shading,
// `!HAS_SUN || mSunIrradiance == vec3(0.0)` in the water and `HAS_SUN && ...` again in the sprites;
// whether a point stands under the water was a subtraction in four files, two of them guarded by
// the sea's constant and two of them not. A frame that changed how it said one of these would have
// had to find every copy. These pair the compile-time constant with the runtime test it stands in
// front of, which is the rule `variants.glsl` states, and every reader asks here.
