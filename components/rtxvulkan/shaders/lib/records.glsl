// **Their own file because the payload and the reprojection read them and nothing else of the
// walks that fill them.** Declared where they were filled, the miss shader compiled the whole of
// the water and the shading to hold a `VisibilityPayload`, and the reprojection pulled in the
// water for one struct.

/// What a shading model made of a surface, in the terms a temporal upscaler demodulates by.
///
/// **Reported by whatever shaded the pixel rather than guessed after it.** Ray Reconstruction
/// separates a noisy pixel into a diffuse and a specular half using the albedos and the roughness it
/// is handed, so those three have to describe what this renderer actually did — and only the
/// function that did it knows. A constant roughness of one, a permanently zero specular albedo and
/// the *flat quad's* normal for water is a description of a renderer nobody wrote.

/// divide the sky's colour by. Nothing of this renderer's own reads the sky's albedo or roughness:
/// the composite multiplies it into a bounce of nought, and the filters know the sky by its normal,
