// and drawn for its bounce, and how much it reflects beside the diffuse half.

// **A surface with no reflectance has no specular half, and is not asked for one.** Every vanilla
// surface is that, so `glossOf` answers it with one test and every step after reads a flag that is
// false; in a scene with no map at all the test is `HAS_MAPS`, a constant, and the half is compiled
