/// by its transport — the shadow and the beam through the fog — and the lamps by what they deliver

/// stores neither, both being the direction's alone; a puff throws by `SMOKE_ANISOTROPY` where the
/// air throws by `fogPhase`, and that is the caller's. What water over the puff leaves of the
/// daylight is put back here too, on the sun and the sky both — `sunInAir` says why the volume
/// carries none of it.

/// **As bright as a card of the same albedo held beside it, and that is not a fudge.** An opaque
