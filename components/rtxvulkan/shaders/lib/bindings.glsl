// Everything the trace is handed: set nought's bindings, and every table the scene owns reached
// through an address the frame block carries.
//
// **The frame's own block carries what is not a table, and where every table is.** The camera, the
// sky, the sea's moments and where the lamps were binned ride there because a record that is one
// row belongs in the block rather than in a descriptor of its own. The tables ride there as
// `GpuTables`, one address apiece, because seventeen storage-buffer bindings pushed twice a frame
// were seventeen places a layout and a write could disagree; `scene.h` says the rest.
//
// **A table is read through a function and never through its reference.** `instanceAt`, `lightAt`
// and their siblings construct the reference from the block and index it, so the alignment each
// reference claims is stated once, beside the table it is for. None of them takes `nonuniformEXT`:
// that decoration is for an index into a descriptor array, and a reference is not one, however the
// index into the table was reached.
//
// **The declarations, and `bindings.h` next door holds the numbers** — set zero's are a fact shared
// with `VisibilityPass`, which writes the same slots. What each channel is *for* is written here,
// beside the thing itself.
//
// **Four sets, by who made what they name.** Set zero is the frame and what it points at, pushed;
// set one is the bindless textures a scene owns; set two is the channels a `GBuffer` owns, numbered
// by `gbuffer.h`, which `GBuffer` reads too; set three is the air a `FogVolume` holds, numbered by `fogvolume.h`. The split is
// not tidiness — the device allows 32 push descriptors and this had reached exactly 32, so every
// list that keeps growing moved to the owner that already holds it.

// The structure below is a query's, and every traversal in the libraries this reaches is a
// query. Declared here and not in each stage, so a stage cannot reach the structure without it.
