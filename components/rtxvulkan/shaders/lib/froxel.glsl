// **Its own file because three of the four want nothing else from the air.** `fogscatter.rgen`
// fills a froxel, `fogintegrate.comp` carries the transmittance down a column and `fogVolumeAlong`
// resolves a distance to a slice — and a shader that only asks where a slice starts should not have
// to pull in a phase function, a light grid and a ray query to find out.
//
// One statement of the curve, so a boundary the scatter pass sampled inside is the boundary the
// integrate pass takes its transmittance over.
