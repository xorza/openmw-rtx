// The sprite tables and the tiles' list over them, as the three bin passes write them and the
// trace reads them.
//
// **One statement of the list's shape, because four shaders indexed it by hand.** The count pass
// and the scan wrote at `1 + tile`, the fill and the trace read at `tile` and `tile + 1`, and the
// rule that makes those one table — entry nought is the head — was prose in `scene.h`. The rect a
// sprite covers was packed in one pass and unpacked in another, sixteen bits a coordinate, with
// the split spelled in both. And each pass declared the tables again with the alignment as a
// literal, where `scene.h` names what each reference may claim.
//
// Nothing here reads the frame, so a pass with no frame block reaches it.
