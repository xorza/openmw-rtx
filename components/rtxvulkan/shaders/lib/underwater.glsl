// What a column of water does to the light crossing it.
//
// **Apart from `water.glsl` because the dependency runs both ways otherwise.** A surface
// below the waterline is lit through this, so `gather` needs it — and `shadeWater` needs
// `gather`. The half that answers "what is left of this light" has no opinion about
// shading and comes first; the half that shades a water surface comes after.
