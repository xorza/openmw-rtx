/// What a stretch of water sends toward whoever is looking down it.

/// **The sky's half is integrated, and the sun's is too everywhere a shaft would not show.** Water is
/// one density everywhere, so a stretch of it has a closed form where the air — which thins with
/// height and drifts — has only a march. That is what lets the same arithmetic be afforded on the
/// eye's own ray, on a reflection and on a refraction alike. Only inside a narrow cone about the
/// sun's own line is anything marched, and there it is because a shaft has structure a closed form
/// cannot hold.
///
/// **The sky, arriving from every direction at once.** A phase function integrates to one over the
/// sphere, so an even sky needs none of it and the whole of what reaches a point scatters. Light
/// that scatters toward the eye had to get down there first: attenuating only the way back — `1 - T`
/// — lets deep water settle at the scattering colour at full sky brightness, which is the milky
/// sheet a real channel is not. Integrating both legs turns that into `(1 - T^2) / 2`, half as
/// bright where it settles and markedly less red, because squaring the transmittance costs red
/// twice over.
///
/// **The sun, arriving along one line, and this is the closed form.** At a point `t` along the ray
/// the sun has crossed `k h(t)` of water to arrive and the scattered light crosses `t` to leave,
/// with `h(t) = h - t d.z` the depth there. Both are exponentials in `t`, so their product is one:
///
///     exp(-o k h) * exp(-o (1 - k d.z) t)
///
/// and the integral over the stretch is `exp(-o k h) (1 - exp(-o g L)) / g` with `g = 1 - k d.z`.
/// **`g` is negative looking up toward the sun**, where a step further along the ray is nearer the
/// surface and better lit — and the product stays bounded anyway, because a ray under the water
/// stops at the surface and `h(L)` never goes below nought.
///
/// **And the sun's half is marched where a shaft would be seen, because a shaft is a caustic.** A
/// beam of sunlight in water is the surface's own lens pattern carried along the ray: the closed
/// form gives the beam's *body* and says nothing about its structure, and the structure is the whole
/// of what makes it read as light through water rather than as haze. Every step takes the same
/// `caustic` a submerged surface takes, at its own depth and its own point of entry — which is why
/// the pattern leans down-sun as it descends instead of standing as a column.
///
/// **And it asks whether the sun reaches that point of entry at all**, which the closed form has no
/// way to. A submerged surface is shadowed because `shadeSurface` traces its own ray and water
/// carries a mask bit that keeps it out of occlusion — so a rock over the sea darkened the bed under
/// it and left the water in front of the bed as bright as ever. The ray goes from where the light
/// met the surface, which the march has already worked out to read the lens at, and it is the
/// surface's own question — `skyVisible`, with the cloud deck in it.
///
/// **Only where the beam is a real share of what the stretch sends**, which is `WATER_SHAFT_FLOOR`.
/// Everywhere else the closed form is the whole answer and nothing is marched.
///
/// **And the water over the stretch, which is no part of the stretch.** `(1 - T^2) / 2` counts what
/// the stretch itself crosses and says nothing about what stands above where it begins. From above
/// there is nothing there — the stretch begins at the surface. From below it is the whole column
/// over the camera, and leaving it out let a sea a thousand units down scatter as brightly as one
/// just under the surface. `daylightReaching` is what a submerged *surface* is already dimmed by,
/// so this is the volume agreeing with the surfaces standing in it, and it is the same factor the
/// sun's half below has carried all along.
///
/// **Kept apart rather than applied**, for the reason `fogAlong` gives: the two halves separate
/// later, because an upscaler demodulates the frame by its albedo and what a path took is not part
/// of one. A caller that wants the single number has `throughWater`.
