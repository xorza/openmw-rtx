// A piece of ground, as one texel of it is read: which of its layers show there, and what each
// shows — its albedo, with the light painted into the layer's texture divided back out, and how
// rough it is.
//
// **Its own file because two shaders read the ground and neither may read it differently.** The
// trace sums a chunk's stack at every hit near enough to keep it; `groundcomposite.comp` sums
// the same stack once into one texture for a chunk far enough to flatten. A flattened chunk and
// its live stack have to be the same ground, so the sum is written here, over the tables handed
// in by address rather than reached through the trace's frame block, which the bake has not got.
//
// **The three tables it reads are declared here** and reached through `bindings.glsl` by the
// trace, so that a table is declared once whichever side constructs the reference.
