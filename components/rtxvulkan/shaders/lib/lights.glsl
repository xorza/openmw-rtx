/// them all costs the same whether one contributes or none do — and the fog made that unaffordable
/// rather than merely wasteful, since a march asks twenty-four times per pixel where a surface asks
/// once per hit.
///
/// A lamp is binned into every cell its reach touches, so this range is complete: the distance test
/// each caller still makes is a refinement of the answer and never a correction to it. A position
/// outside the grid is one no lamp can reach, which is why falling off the edge returns nothing
