// **Its own file because a second pass samples them.** The trace has this by way of everything else
// it is handed; the display pass draws the sky's own points at the resolution they are shown at, and
// needs the sheet and none of the rest of `bindings.glsl`. The set and its bindings are the
// host's as well, so both sides read them from `sets.h` and `scene.h`.

// **The extension travels with the declaration**, because what needs it is the indexing rather than
// the pass: a shader that includes this and forgets the line fails to compile, which is the failure
// worth having.

/// for the whole wave. That is a wrong texture on some lanes of some waves, which looks like nothing
