//
// **The trace's depth and not a depth attachment**, because the picture has none: what is drawn
// under these lines was traced, and its distances are in `Channel::Surface` at the traced extent.
// The offset from the eye is interpolated across the primitive and measured here, so a long line
// running into a wall stops where the wall is rather than where its ends' distances say. In the
// display's own values, as the interface is, because the drawers painted their colours against a
// monitor.
