// How many layers of its own emitter stand between each sprite and a light, counted each frame.
//
// **A column of smoke has a sunlit side and a shaded side, and nothing per sprite can give it
// one.** The bake shadows a puff by its own texture and the wrap gives it a side, but the eye
// composites twenty of them over a pixel and their coverage-weighted mean washes what each did into
// one flat colour. What a column needs is shadow *between* sprites: what the ones nearer the sun
// leave of it for the ones behind. That is a question about the emitter's sprites and the light
// alone, so it is answered once per frame and the trace reads one number per sprite per light.
//
// **Counted in layers and not in transmittance, because this does not hold the texture.** A sprite
// that stands in the light's path to another counts for its own fade — one layer for a whole puff,
// a fraction for a wisp — and the trace thins the light by what one layer of that texture hides on
// average, which is the texture's coarsest level. `(1 - mean) ^ layers` is exact where every layer
// is whole, and for a faded one it is the approximation the bake already takes.
//
// **A grid across the light and not every pair**, so that a storm's thousands cost per sprite what
// a candle's dozen do. Sprites are walked from the light outward; each reads what has been laid
// down at its own point and then lays its own disc down on top. The grid is the emitter's reach,
// square, and a disc lands on it as an antialiased footprint: whole inside, a one-cell ramp at the
// rim — which keeps the disc's area to first order — and its area as a point where it is too small
// to reach a cell's centre.
//
// Only what covers and faces the eye is shaded. A flame emits and shadows nothing of its own kind,
// and a rain streak is a thin thing seen by what passes through it.
//
// **On the device and not the host, and Vivec is why.** The same arithmetic in a loop on the
// processor is a fifth of a crowded view's CPU frame — the one place in the corpus where the
// processor, not the card, decides how long a frame takes. There is no host copy kept beside this
// as a reference: two implementations of one computation are two things to keep in step, and
// what a layer count is belongs in one place.
//
// **One workgroup per emitter per light, and one lane per cell of the grid.** A sprite reads what
// the sprites nearer the light have laid down, then every lane adds its own cell's coverage of that
// sprite's disc — so the sequence over sprites is serial, which is what the answer depends on, and
// the parallelism is across the grid, which is where it changes nothing. `spriteshade.comp` holds
// the grid's own size and everything else only it reads.
//
// **The depth order is sorted into a buffer and not into shared memory**, which is what lets a run
// be any length. Shared memory caps it, a cap needs something to shade what is past the cap, and
// that something is the second implementation this has none of.
