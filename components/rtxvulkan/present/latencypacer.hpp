    /// The driver's frame pacing over one swapchain — Reflex, `VK_NV_low_latency2`. One sleep

    /// driver lengthens until the frame's input is sampled as late as it will still reach the
    /// screen on time; the markers that tell the driver where the frame's simulation, submission
    /// and present begin and end; and the id every present and every submit carries so the
    /// driver can tell one frame's markers from the next's.
    ///
    /// **Every present is paced where the driver paces at all.** The mode is a flag inside the
    /// sleep mode and the frame-rate limit is the interval the sleep enforces, so an application
    /// that turned the calls off with the mode would sleep at a worse spot, in its own limiter,
    /// after the present. Dormant — every call nothing — where the device or the surface paces
    /// nothing, which is the same shape as no extension.
    ///
    /// **A frame is one sleep to one present, and the turns say where it stands.** The driver
    /// counts one sleep between two presents; a window hidden, or a present that never reached
    /// the call, leaves the frame open, and the next sleep is refused until a present closes it. A
    /// present with no sleep before it — a loading screen's, a message box's — pays the sleep it
    /// owes before its acquire, at a worse spot, so the driver's count holds.
    ///
    /// **The sleep's wait is not the queue's clock.** `Timeline` says every wait is the device's,
    /// because a wait is where what the queue has passed changes; nothing on the queue signals
    /// this semaphore, so waiting on it changes nothing about what may be freed.
    ///
    /// Made from the device's entry points and not from the device, so a test can stand in for
    /// every call: what this class decides — the turns, the ids, the markers' order — is host
    /// logic, and the tests that reach it have no device. The price is that a device lost inside
    /// the sleep's wait is reported without the fault description a queue wait would carry; the
