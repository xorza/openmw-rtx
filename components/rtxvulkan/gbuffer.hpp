    /// **A picture cannot be filtered and these can.** One bounce per pixel is noisy, and the only

    /// which means the light has to still be separate from the surface it landed on when the blur
    /// reaches it. By the time a pixel is a colour, the albedo has been multiplied in, the fog has
    /// been laid over it and the curve has been applied; there is nothing left to filter that would
    /// not also smear the wall's texture.
    ///
    /// So the trace writes what it knows in the form the next pass can use, and the composite puts
    /// it back together:
    ///
    ///     colour = direct + albedo * filter(indirect * transmittance)
    ///
    /// **And this is the same buffer Ray Reconstruction reads.** It asks for exactly this —
    /// demodulated radiance, the albedo to put back, normals and depth — so the split earns its
    /// place twice over even if the filter written on top of it is later replaced.
