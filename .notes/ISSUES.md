# Open issues

- An exterior's fog extinction is derived from a different distance in the two paths. The harness
  measures it over `Rtx::distantLandReach()` (`components/rtx/lightbuilder.cpp:185`); the game
  measures it over the ramp `MWRender::FogManager` built from `viewing distance`
  (`apps/openmw/mwrender/rtx/rtxrenderer.cpp`). At the shipped defaults those are 32768 and 7168
  units, so a screenshot and a played frame stand in different air.
