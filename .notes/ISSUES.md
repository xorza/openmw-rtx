# Open issues

- **A minimized window keeps drawing on KDE Wayland.** Minimized through KWin with vsync on, the
  game went on tracing and presenting at about 31 frames a second (the title read "31 fps, 32.0 ms"):
  the engine stops drawing on SDL's hidden and minimized events, xdg-shell sends neither, and
  `SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_OCCLUDED` is not handled (`components/sdlutil/sdlinputwrapper.cpp`).
