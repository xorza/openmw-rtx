# Review: the fork's diff against upstream

Scope: `git diff 2f0688aa59 HEAD` (merge base with `upstream/master`), without tests and without
`extern/fidelityfx`. Whoever addresses an item deletes it. When a group is empty, delete its heading.

## Stale or false comments

- [ ] `components/rtx/renderer/frameimage.cpp:68` — says that the rasterizer's thumbnail is cut by
  `Misc::cropToAspect`. `MWRender::ScreenshotManager` crops in double and does not call it. Target shape:
  the comment says what the rasterizer does. (low)
- [ ] `components/rtxvulkan/shaders/lib/traversal.glsl:366` — the `MEET_BY_CHANCE` doc lists "the reuse's
  rays". (low)
- [ ] `components/rtxvulkan/shaders/lib/payload.glsl:10` — says "twenty-five words". The struct has
  twenty-six (`:144`). (low)
- [ ] `components/rtxvulkan/trace/tracemedia.hpp:59` — "Nothing may be in flight: `WavePass::describe`
  says why" contradicts `WavePass::describe` (`wavepass.hpp:35-37`) and `VulkanRenderer::setSea`
  (`vulkanrenderer.hpp:115-117`). Target shape: one statement of the contract. (low)
- [ ] `components/rtxvulkan/trace/tracechain.hpp:39-41` — says pictures "are traced and waited for one at
  a time". Pictures are deferred, and nothing waits for them (`picturetracer.hpp:40-44`). One bin is safe
  only because of queue order (`spritebin.hpp:82-83`). Target shape: give that reason here. (low)
- [ ] `components/myguirtx/rendermanager.cpp:96,199,268` — `checkTexture` says that the backend supports
  external textures, but `doRender` `static_cast`s each `ITexture` to `SlotTexture`, which is undefined for
  an external one. `:268` says "two pipelines", but `GuiPass` has five (`gui/guipass.hpp:225-229`). Target
  shape: correct comments, and an assert that the texture is a `SlotTexture`. (low)
- [ ] `components/rtx/view/offscreentrace.hpp:80` — names `readGuiTexture`, which no longer exists
  (`Renderer::takeGuiCopy`/`takeCopy`). (low)
- [ ] `components/rtx/world/moon.cpp:46-48` — `foldedPhase` says "Morrowind's phases are
  multiples of a quarter pi, so the fold is a subtraction". The phase is now the continuous
  `MoonState::mPhaseEighths`. (low)
- [ ] `components/sky/vertexrules.hpp:41-46` — says "exactly white, and nothing else", but
  `starVertexShown` tests only `colour.x() == 1.f`. Target shape: the doc states the red-channel rule. (low)

## Include and header conventions

- [ ] `components/misc/presentation.hpp:1`, `components/sdlutil/sdldisplay.hpp:1` — new fork headers with
  `#ifndef` guards. Target shape: `#pragma once`. (low)
- [ ] `components/sceneutil/stableidentity.hpp:66` — uses `typeid` without `<typeinfo>`. (low)
- [ ] `components/crashcatcher/crashimagelinux.cpp:84,92` — uses `std::size_t` without `<cstddef>`. (low)
- [ ] `components/rtxvulkan/pipeline/shadercode.cpp:97` — uses `std::move` without `<utility>`. (low)
