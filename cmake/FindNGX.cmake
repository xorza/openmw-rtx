#[=======================================================================[.rst:
FindNGX
-------

Find NVIDIA's NGX SDK, which is what DLSS is: a static library, its headers and the signed
feature libraries it loads at runtime. Prebuilt and licensed by NVIDIA rather than by this tree,
so it is found rather than vendored; a checkout of https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS is one.

Use this module by invoking find_package with the form::

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(NGX
    [version] [EXACT]      # The feature libraries' version, e.g. 310.9.1
    [REQUIRED]             # Fail with error if NGX is not found
  )

Point it at the checkout the way CMake points every package: ``NGX_ROOT``, as a cache entry or in
the environment, or ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``.

Imported targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets:

.. variable:: NGX::NGX

  The static library, its headers and the loader it dlopens the features with. The headers are
  system headers, as those of every imported target are, because they are NVIDIA's and a warning in
  them is not ours to fix.

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: NGX_FOUND

  Set to true if the SDK was found, otherwise false or undefined.

.. variable:: NGX_VERSION

  The version the feature libraries carry: in their file names on Linux, in their version
  resource on Windows.

.. variable:: NGX_FEATURE_DIR

  The directory holding the release feature libraries.

.. variable:: NGX_FEATURE_LIBRARY

  The Ray Reconstruction feature library in that directory, ``nvngx_dlssd.dll`` or
  ``libnvidia-ngx-dlssd.so.<version>``: the one the backend loads, and so the one a build places
  beside its binaries and an install ships.

Cache variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For users who wish to edit and control the module behavior, this module
reads hints about search locations from the following variables::

.. variable:: NGX_INCLUDE_DIR

  Path to the include directory with ``nvsdk_ngx.h``.

.. variable:: NGX_LIBRARY

  Path to ``libnvsdk_ngx.a``, or on Windows to ``nvsdk_ngx_d.lib``.

.. variable:: NGX_LIBRARY_DEBUG

  Windows only: path to ``nvsdk_ngx_d_dbg.lib``, the build against the debug runtime.

NOTE: The variables above should not usually be used in CMakeLists.txt files!

### Find library ##############################################################
# The SDK lays each platform out under its own directory and names the library differently in
# each. On Windows the `_d` suffix is the dynamic C runtime, the one every configuration but Debug
# links, and `_dbg` its debug counterpart: an object compiled against one runtime does not link
# against a library built for the other.

### Find the feature libraries and their version ##############################
# The `major.minor.build` a Windows DLL states in its version resource, or empty where it has
# none. Read by the system's own reader, because CMake has no command for the format and the
# feature DLLs carry no version in their names the way the Linux libraries do: one start of
# PowerShell per configure, which is the price of not parsing a PE file by hand. `FileVersionInfo`
# is .NET's, so Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7 answer alike.
