# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A fork of OpenMW 0.52 whose purpose is an **experimental ray-traced renderer**. Upstream OpenMW is
the host engine — cells, references, physics, scripts, animation, weather, GUI — and it keeps all of
that. What it stops owning is the picture.

Three documents, and they do not overlap:

- **`docs/rtx/openmw.md`** — how the host engine is built and where the seams are. Read before touching
  anything in `apps/openmw/mwrender/`, `components/sceneutil/`, `components/resource/` or the
  settings plumbing.
- **`docs/rtx/plan.md`** — the route: the scene-mirroring decision, the milestones, the tooling.
- **this file** — goals and working rules. Status goes in commits, never here.

The reference implementation is **`/home/xxorza/Projects/rtxmw/`** — a Rust Morrowind ray tracer
with working water, caustics and volumetric fog. Its `docs/design.md` is 3,400 lines of accumulated
findings, most of which are about *Morrowind's content*, not about Rust: ray offsets on sheet
geometry, discarded outermost transforms, Z-first Euler angles, the pre-lit albedo problem, DLSS
parameter traps. **Read the relevant section before debugging something that looks already solved.**
Its shaders are more current than its prose. Its licence is MIT OR Apache-2.0 and it is the same
author's; this fork is GPLv3.

## Posture

A 2002 game made to look astonishing on current hardware — ray-traced visibility, path-traced
indirect light, materials recovered from pre-lit vanilla textures, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, opacity
micromaps, SER. Vanilla content, new light transport.

Priorities, in order:

1. **How it looks.** Trading image quality for simplicity or convenience is the wrong trade.
2. **Performance.** 1920×1080 internal → 3840×2160 at 60 fps (`docs/rtx/plan.md` §5).

Nothing else ranks: no mod compatibility, no configurability for its own sake, no portability layer,
no abstraction over hardware this does not target.

**Feature-complete first, then fast.** That order is about sequencing and not about the two above:
performance still loses to how it looks, and it also waits. Until the renderer draws everything the
game has, an optimisation is aimed at a frame that is about to change shape — the thing made cheap
turns out not to be the expensive one once the missing half arrives, and the measurement it was
justified by has to be taken again anyway.

So: land what is missing, **measure what it costs the moment it lands**, and write the number down
rather than acting on it. That list is what M12 is for. The exception is a cost so large it stops
the work — something that makes the harness too slow to look at, or a frame too slow to judge — and
that is a judgement to state out loud, not a licence.

Sports programming — strongest technique over safest, fast path first, delete what stopped earning
its place, settle arguments by measuring. Nothing here is published, so rewriting beats working
around.

### What that means against upstream

Upstream's constraints are not ours. Where they conflict, ours win.

- **Two renderers in one binary, one of them chosen at startup — and the other is then never
  started.** `-DOPENMW_RTX=ON` decides whether the ray tracer is *built*; `[RTX] enabled` decides
  whether it *runs*, read once before the window exists. Not a refactor of the existing renderer, not
  a strategy pattern bolted onto `RenderingManager`.

  **With it on, OpenGL is not initialized at all** — no GL context, no `osgViewer` graphics window,
  no interop, no rasterized frame underneath. The window is an SDL surface for Vulkan, the GUI is
  drawn by Vulkan, and the inventory doll and the maps are traces rather than render-to-texture
  passes. OSG stays, as a scene graph and a content loader; `openmw-rtxtool` has proved since M0
  that it needs no GL context to be either.

  **With it off, the tree behaves exactly as upstream does.** The rasterizer is not modified, not
  wrapped and not conditionally compiled around — it is simply the path not taken. Keeping it that
  way is what makes "does the RT path do this correctly" answerable by comparison.
- **No merge-back discipline.** This fork is not upstreaming. Do not shape a change around what a
  GitLab reviewer would accept.
- **Rasterizer workarounds do not come across.** Render-bin ordering, the transparent pass, the
  distortion pass, shadow-map tuning — the RT path answers those questions with rays.
- **A missing extension or feature is a hard failure naming it**, never a fallback path.

### Two renderers

The picture is reached twice — **Vulkan on Ada-class NVIDIA, Metal on Apple silicon** — as two
backends behind one API-neutral core, not a portability layer over either (`docs/rtx/backends.md`).

Content, light transport and what the scene *is* live in the core, written once. What is true of an
API lives in its backend, written twice, and that cost is paid rather than abstracted away.

**Each machine develops its own renderer and leaves the other alone.** The backend this box cannot
run is not built, tested or debugged here; its skipped tests are the result, not a gap to close. The
core is the exception — a mistake there is one nobody here can see.

## Commands

Configure once. Turning off the Qt tools cuts the build roughly in half:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON \
  -DOPENMW_RTX=ON \
  -DOPENMW_DLSS_SDK=/home/xxorza/Projects/rtxmw/.refs/dlss \
  -DBUILD_COMPONENTS_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_OPENMW_TESTS=ON \
  -DBUILD_OPENCS=OFF -DBUILD_WIZARD=OFF -DBUILD_ESSIMPORTER=OFF \
  -DBUILD_MWINIIMPORTER=OFF -DBUILD_OPENCS_TESTS=OFF \
  -DOPENMW_USE_SYSTEM_RECASTNAVIGATION=ON -DOPENMW_USE_SYSTEM_GOOGLETEST=ON \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache \
  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=mold
```

If it ever has to be configured again: **`bullet-dp`, not `bullet`** — OpenMW needs a
double-precision Bullet, the two Arch packages conflict, and the single-precision one has to come out
first. Targets are `openmw`, `openmw-rtxtool` (the usual inner loop), `components-tests`,
`openmw-tests`.

**Never `cmake --build --clean-first`.** Upstream declares `files/lang/*.ts` — translation files in
the *source* tree, with thousands of human translations in them — as build byproducts of the
`translations` target. Cleaning deletes them, and the rebuild regenerates them from scratch with
`lupdate`, so every translation becomes `type="unfinished"`. `git checkout -- files/lang/` puts them
back. Delete the build directory instead if a clean build is really wanted.

Tests are gtest binaries run directly — `./build/components-tests`, `./build/openmw-tests`, with
`--gtest_filter`. **There is no ctest registration in this project.**

Formatting and the other CI gates:

```sh
CLANG_FORMAT=clang-format-14 CI/check_clang_format.sh   # CI pins 14; this box has 22, they differ
CI/check_file_names.sh
CI/check_cmake_format.sh
clang-format -i <file>...
```

Running things:

```sh
cd build                       # --resources defaults to ./resources, so the tool runs from here

./openmw-rtxtool                                   # a window on the ship at Seyda Neen
./openmw-rtxtool view --view=balmora               # a window somewhere else; F1 lists its keys
./openmw-rtxtool shot --view=balmora --out=b.png   # one frame, no window — the default way to look
./openmw-rtxtool scene --view=balmora --twice      # what the renderer was handed
./openmw-rtxtool scene --list-views                # the named viewpoints
./openmw-rtxtool info                              # the device and its ray tracing limits

./openmw --skip-menu --new-game --start "Seyda Neen, Census and Excise Office"
```

`~/.config/openmw/openmw.cfg` points at the Morrowind install (GOTY, `/home/Games/Morrowind`), so
none of these needs `--data`; views live in `files/rtx/views.cfg`. Tests that need game data **skip**
when it is absent and **fail** when the path is set and wrong — a silent skip looks like a pass.

### Verification, after changing code and before saying it works

Build the targets you touched, run the test binary that covers them with a filter, then format.
Building the world to check a one-line change in the harness is waste; so is claiming a change works
because it compiled.

**Do not open the game window to check a rendering change.** `openmw-rtxtool shot` renders the real
renderer headlessly in about a second and prints a summary line — hit fraction, camera, frame time —
so a change is checkable without a screenshot ever being looked at.

`openmw-rtxtool view` opens a window, which is for the things only a window shows: how something
moves, how it holds up while you fly through it, whether an artefact is a still or a shimmer. It
takes `--frames N` so it can also be run by something that cannot click — which is how the window
path gets exercised under the validation layers.

In the window, **P** prints the camera as a `views.cfg` block and **F3** prints the whole frame as a
command line. A file of those lines is a profiling corpus: each one renders that frame again under
`shot`.

## Architecture, in one screen

OpenMW is OpenSceneGraph 3.6 on OpenGL. `Engine::frame` (`apps/openmw/engine.cpp:191`) runs
simulation, then `updateTraversal()`, then `renderingTraversals()` — and **that last call is the only
thing the RT renderer displaces**. Cull still runs: CPU skinning, terrain LOD and object paging are
all cull-time decisions (`docs/rtx/openmw.md` §3.4).

`MWRender::RenderingManager` (`apps/openmw/mwrender/renderingmanager.hpp`) is the rendering
god-object, owned by `MWWorld::World`. There is one abstract interface in the whole rendering layer
and it has one method, so **the seam has to be cut, not found**.

The RT renderer takes its scene by **mirroring the live OSG scene graph**, because by cull time the
world is already CPU-resident triangles with world transforms, resolved texture roles and — for
actors — already-skinned vertex positions. It reaches the screen through **GL/Vulkan interop**, not a
Vulkan window, so the GUI, the inventory doll, the local map and video playback keep working. Both
decisions and their alternatives are in `docs/rtx/plan.md` §2–3.

Code lives in `components/rtx/` (Vulkan, knows no OSG scene graph and no game headers),
`components/rtxbridge/` (`osg::Node` → scene description), `apps/openmw/mwrender/rtx/` (the game-side
owner) and `apps/rtxtool/` (the headless harness).

## Conventions

**C++20, `.clang-format` at 120 columns.** The user's global Rust rules do not apply to this tree;
the posture behind them does.

- **Comments say *why*.** A block comment on a type or a non-obvious function says what it is for.
  Inside a body, a comment earns its place by naming an invariant, a workaround and its cause, or a
  trade-off against the obvious alternative — never by restating the line under it. No decorative
  dividers.
- **Fix stale narration in code you are already editing**, like fixing indentation on a line you are
  changing. Sweeping files you are not otherwise in is a separate task.
- **Frame times are uniform, and an average that hides a spike is not an answer.** A cost that is
  cheap on most frames and enormous on one is worse than the same total spread evenly: the spike is
  a dropped frame and a visible hitch, and no amount of amortising makes it not one. So work is made
  *incremental*, never *batched behind a threshold* — a table grows and recycles its slots rather
  than being compacted when enough of it has died, and a resource is appended rather than rebuilt
  when it changes. If an operation cannot be made cheap, it belongs off the frame path entirely, not
  on a rota. Report the p99 and the worst frame beside the median, because those are the ones a
  player feels.
- **Allocation is a metric on the frame path.** Persistent scratch buffers refilled with `clear()`,
  results into an out-parameter, nothing that constructs a `std::string` or a `std::function` per
  frame, logging that compiles out. There is a test that enforces this (`docs/rtx/plan.md` §7.3).
- **Asserts** guard contracts the code must keep, not data the world might supply. Hot paths use the
  debug-only form; untrusted input is never an assert.
