# **What `--offcpu` can and cannot see.** BPF collects its stacks by frame pointer and the graphics
# driver has none, so a wait that starts inside `vkWaitForFences` is recorded as an address rather
# than as the frame that asked for it. `--dwarf` does not help there: a BPF-collected stack cannot
# be unwound any other way. What the mode does establish is the shape — which library the process
# waits in, and whether a wait passes through this fork's own code at all. Read the by-library
# table; the total above it is dominated by driver worker threads parked for the length of the run.
#
# **It profiles the build `release.sh` measures, and does not have one of its own.** A profile is
# only as good as its call graph, and a stock Release build has neither line numbers nor frame
# pointers — so `release.sh` carries `-g1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer` instead, measured at 0.2%. A
# second build directory would have cost nothing less and explained a frame nobody timed.
