#
# `release.sh game` builds and runs OpenMW itself on the quicksave instead, `release.sh build` only
# builds, and `release.sh bench` measures — which is what an optimised build with no layers in it is
# for. `profile.sh` is where the measurement turns into an explanation.

# **Light debug data and frame pointers, in the build the numbers are quoted from.** `-g1` is line
# tables and nothing else — no locals, no types — so it costs nothing at runtime and a profile can
# name a line rather than an offset. `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` measured at 0.2% here, against a
# run-to-run spread of 2.7%, and it is what lets perf walk a stack for the price of reading it.
#
# Both are on the measured build rather than on a profiling build beside it, because two binaries
# means the profile explains a frame the benchmark did not time. Arch builds every library in this
# process with the same two flags, so the chain already runs out through libstdc++, OSG and SDL.
